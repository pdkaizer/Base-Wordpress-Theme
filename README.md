Getting Started
---------------

Download `WP Base` from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the `WP Base` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `my-awesome-theme`), and then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

Search for: 'WP_Base' and replace with: 'my-awesome-theme'
