Getting Started
---------------

Download or clone 'WP Base' from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the `WP Base` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, 'my-awesome-theme'), and then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

* Search for: 'WP_Base' and replace with: 'my-awesome-theme'
* Search for: WP_Base_ and replace with: my-awesome-theme_
* Search for:  WP_Base and replace with:  my-awesome-theme
* Search for: WP_Base- and replace with: my-awesome-theme-

In terminal cd into your theme directory and `npm install`
